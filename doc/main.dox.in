\section sec_abstract Abstract

This is a C++11 library for maritime navigation purposes.
It supports (partially):
- NMEA-0183
- AIS
- SeaTalk (Raymarine device communication)
- Reading data from serial ports (NMEA, SeaTalk)
- Basic geodesic functions, suitable for martime navigation.

See a more detailed list: \ref page_features

\section sec_goals Goals

There are already implementaions for reading and writing NMEA-0183 or AIS.
The goal of this library is
- to have an implementation in modern C++ (C++11 right now, C++14 as soon as compilers
  catch up)
- easy to use API (std lib like, integrating well)
- unit tested (high test coverage)
- trivial integration into projects (liberal license, as few dependencies as
  possible)
- (more or less) well documented
